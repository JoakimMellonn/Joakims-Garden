## Forklaringer

1. Responsibility-driven design
2. Cohesion
	1. Cohesion describes how some code maps to a task or entity.
	2. We strive for high cohesion, when designing classes.
	3. Having high cohesion means that a single unit of code (methods...), is only responsible for a single well-defined task.
3. Coupling
	1. Coupling describes to interconnectedness of classes.
	2. When designing well-designed classes, we strive to achieve as loose coupling as possible.
	4. Classes should communicate via a small well defined interface.
	3. Loose coupling means that when you make changes to one class, you don't have to change something in another. Meaning all classes should be independent of each other.
	5. Tight coupling means that classes depend on each other, and when you make changes to one, you'll need to make changes to the others too, this bad.
	6. Implicit coupling is worse than tight coupling, since the compiler won't be able to find the errors when you make changes to implicitly coupled classes.
4. Encapsulation
	1. Proper encapsulation reduces coupling and gives a better class design.
	2. Encapsulation means hiding implementation from view, ergo making fields private and only getter methods.
5. Localising change
	1. Loose coupling makes it so changes to one class, shouldn't need changes to another, this is also called Localising change.
6. Code duplication
	1. Code duplication is having the same piece of code more than once.
	2. Bad for design.
7. Refactoring
	1. Refactoring is when you change the structure of a program, to make it more readable or to easier introduce new features.
	2. When refactoring you mostly split one class into two or more classes, but you can also splice two or more classes.
8. Enumerated types
	1. An enumerated type is simply a type with some predefined values.
	2. You can't create objects of an enumerated type. But each name in the definition represents a unique instance of the type.
	3. Enumerated types isn't values, but proper objects.
	4. Enumerated types can be used effectively in combination with a switch statement.


### Eksempler

```java
public enum CommandWord {
	GO("go"), QUIT("quit"), HELP("help"), UNKNOWN("?");

	private String commandString;

	CommandWord(String commandString) {
		this.commandString = commandString;
	}

	public String toString() {
		return commandString;
	}
}
```
