No by this I don't mean what most people in the keyboard world would call a "custom keyboard", I've traversed into field of keyboard, in which very few people have. Completely custom keyboards, where you 3d-print the chassis, solder all the switches, and have to choose a micro-controller from a selection of a few dozens. 
But why would anyone ever do that? Save some money on an otherwise overprized keyboard, as a quite complicated hobby project, or just because you wan't to use some 30+ hours of your life into something. For me all those were the reason for me to dip my feet into this world.
For some time now I have been quite interested in the world of keyboards, and in the summer it came to a point where I bought my first custom keyboard, the Keychron Q1. With that keyboard I also bought some extra keycaps, making it more expensive for sure, but more importantly: my own.
