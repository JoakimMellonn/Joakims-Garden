# Ohms Law (and Watt)
![[Ohms_Law.jpg|350]]

Voltage, Current and Resistance are all related with Ohms law. $I$ means 'Intensit√§t'.

$$Voltage (V) = Current (I) \cdot Resistance (R)$$
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$
$$R=\frac{V}{I}$$
## Watt
To calculate Watt we can also use Ohms law to help us:
$$Watt(P)=V\cdot I$$
$$P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}$$
$$P=I^{2}\cdot R$$
# Components
## Resistors
Resistors can be used to limit the amount of current running through a system.
Unit is Ohms $(\Omega)$.

Resistors use a color code to show resistance:
1. First digit
2. Second digit
3. Third digit
4. Multiplier
5. Tolerance

It is much easier to measure with a multimeter.

### Pull-up/Pull-down Resistors
They are used to ensure a signal to a pin is in HIGH/LOW state.

- Pull-up: resistor connected directly to VCC
- Pull-down: resistor connected directly to Ground

## Series and Parallel Circuits
Current flow towards a lower voltage (from high to low). There will always flow current through every part of a circuit.

### Series
Components are in series when they are placed back to back in the circuit, so the same current flows through them.

### Parallel
Components are in parallel when they placed besides each other in the circuit, so the current is split between them.
In parallel all components will have the same voltage drop across them.

### Batteries
- Series: batteries in series have their relative voltage added.
- Parallel: batteries in parallel have their current added (with batteries it is the capacity).

### Resistors
- Series: Adds the resistance.
$$R_{1}+R_{2}+R_3+...$$
- Parallel: Decreases the resistance.
$$R_{Total}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+...$$


# Voltage Dividers
A Voltage divider can be used to turn a large voltage into a smaller one. This is done by using two resistors in series where $V_{out}$ is between the two resistors.
![[Voltage_Divider.jpg|250]]

$$V_{out}=V_{in} \cdot \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}$$

## Variable [[#Resistors]]
Variable resistors is like the name implies, a component which can change its resistance.
- Potentiometers.
- Photocell (LDR, Light Dependent Resistor).
- Thermistor.
