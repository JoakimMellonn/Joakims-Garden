You might ask yourself this exact question: "What have brought me here in this situation?". To that I will say, I don't know, I'm busy enough finding out what have brought me here in this situation. That is what I will try and answer in this blog post, so hopefully I will have the answer to the question by the end of writing this. Let's see.

# My background
Before looking into where I am now, I would like to shortly go over my background. I'm only 22, so it won't take long.

It all started a little over 22 years ago in a small city called Harlev just outside of Aarhus, Denmark. From here I don't really remember much, ask my parents (please don't). Let's just skip the next 13 ish years.

13 years old, naive, and filled to the brim with pimples, I sat in my room spending most of my time playing Battlefield 4 (damn good game). Actually the game so good, I thought to myself: "I want to make a game myself". So I did what apparently 2.5 million others have thought to do, and go and watch Brackeys 2D platformer guide. About ten minutes into this experience, I thought that I could pretty much rule the world. From here I began using my free time doing things in Unity, not necessarily anything usable. This was my first dapping in the world of programming and software development. And to present me's surprise, it wasn't the worst experience, who would've known C# wasn't the worst beginners language.

Fast forwarding two years, I'm now 15 and about to go to boarding school, this is very popular in Denmark btw. Guess what, I found a boarding school with game development as one of their subjects or field of study (don't know what to call it). Of course 15 year old me, with 2 years of mediocre game development in my fingers, thought I would chase the career as a game developer. This was an absolute no-brainer for me. I had a lot of fun doing this, until I didn't. After about 2/3 of the boarding school year, I decided to switch to some other field of study. Why did I do that? Well because I was bored shitless.

Now we come to high school Joakim, going what is broadly accepted as the nerd high school in Denmark: HTX (Higher technical exam, very roughly translated). In the first two years of high school, the only actual programming I did was some HTML/CSS and creating a game in Unity (which was a quite fun assignment after the pause I had from game development). Come to the third and final year of high school, I began using Arduino for the assignments in school. This was really just awesome, I can't describe how much fun I had using Arduino. It was at this point I finally found out what I will be doing with my life: IT product development. Whether it would be physical products or software only products, I'm still yet to find out.

The two gap years I then had between finishing high school and starting studying at Aarhus University, I will be keeping quite short in this part. Because much of it I'm still working today. To keep it short: I started my own software company.

# Starting my own company
In August 2021 I started my own software company called Mellonn. Now what is this company all about? You might ask. To answer this question there's something I haven't told you guys about, yet.

I LOVE making computers do things for me.

Doesn't have to be anything particularly advanced, just an assignment I otherwise had to do, that the computer could do for me. That is just satisfying on so many levels and I think that most of us know this feeling in some way. Now, how does this answer the question? Well, one thing that is extremely cool (in my opinion) and definitely contributes to automating tasks with computers: AI.

I've always been very interested in AI, also before the days of chatGPT. Although that explosion isn't too long ago, it does feel like the world of AI has moved faster than a Formula 1 car since then. I absolutely love it, I'm spending most of my spare time learning about the newest innovations in AI. That's why I've made my own company. 

"Oh no, not another AI startup" you might say. And to that I say YES.

In my personal opinion we need as many new AI startups as possible. Why's that? It's because the more companies willing to invest time and money in advancing AI, the more innovation will happen and the more competition there will be (cheaper prices). 

The thing Mellonn is focusing on inside the space of AI is making it more accessible for the average person. By making it solve some of the tedious or irritating tasks we have in our everyday lives. The first one being transcribing interviews. Who doesn't wanna save time doing that? Especially as an IT-product development student I wanna save as much time transcribing as possible. Which brings me right into the next and final part of this introduction to my life.

# Studying IT-product development
For the past years time I've been busy studying IT-product development at Aarhus University. Not a particularly prestigious education or institution, but it does it's job. And I must say this is some of the most fun I've ever had going to "school". This particular education is focusing on becoming a jack of all trades when it comes to developing IT-products. Not becoming the best at anything, but learning about all the parts needed to built the best products.

Why did I choose this? Well I wanted something that wasn't as theoretical as computer science, but still have a lot of those aspects. And IT-product development is a good cocktail of design, computer science and prototyping. With prototyping being the very fun part! Although I shouldn't forget to mention how much I also love the design and computer science parts.
