# Mellonn Be Quiet is in production
I've been wanting to tell you about this project for weeks! Mellonn Be Quiet will be Mellonn's newest product, in our ever expanding catalogue. With this new and revolutionising product, Mellonn will be taking over the world of interviews. Mellonn Be Quiet will be using the most advanced technology, to take away the need to even do interviews at all. Let's take a deeper look at how this will work.


## What is Mellonn Be Quiet?
What a great question, I'm glad you asked! Imagine that you have to do an interview with someone, yeah I wouldn't do that either... That's exactly why I'm making this app, I don't wanna do interviews anymore, it would mean that I would have to socialise, and even worse, transcribe it! Well... With Mellonn Be Quiet, you just have to write the full name of the person, you wan't to interview, give the topic/question of the interview, and Mellonn Be Quiet will do the rest! In less time than it takes for you to even think about, what the interview will be about, Mellonn Be Quiet will have a full transcription ready for you. Aaaaand, wait for it... The full audio recording as well!


### How does this work?
It's actually quite simple if you think about it. What else should we do with all the data, Meta, Google and all the other megacorps, collect from us? Well, we've got it all, don't ask how we got it, you don't wanna know. When you go and write a name on the person you want to interview, the app will automatically collect all the data on that person, and of course the data on you too. It will now you that data, to create an exact representation of what an interview, between you and that person would be, on the given topic.
And yes this means, that you will be able to ask Mark Zuckerberg, how this works once the app is released. I can already now tell you, you don't wanna know that, but you just go ask him yourself!
To make the audio recordings, we will be using even more of the data, collected by the megacorps. You thought Alexa, Google and Siri only listened when you called on them? I'm sorry to tell you... Those millions, or even billions of hours of recordings, will be coming to good use. All that audio will of course be divided into the single words, and automatically be set together by the AI, when the transcript is done. And you won't even be able to hear it's not you... cool, right?!

### Ethics and GDPR
HAH!

### Pricing and availability
One of the other things this AI can be used for, is of course to tell me what you're asking when you read this. Right now you're of course saying "Shut up and take my money!", right after this you're of course asking when this will be available. My answer will be that you're gonna have to wait a little, because the answer is April 1st. 2023.
And now the AI is telling me, that you're asking the price of this essential peace of genius... Before answering this, I will tell you that this project, could have never been a reality, if it weren't for you, yes you. Without you using all of today's best services, we would never have this much data! And now you would probably think, that this data should be free to get back, since it is yours. That's where you're wrong... Of course it's gonna cost you money! You've already paid your data, all I'm asking is that you now pay 100$/hr of interview generated, what a steal!


## Yes
This was this year's april fools joke...


## What's next?
Okay, jokes aside. I won't be coming with a real blog post this week, I've done a lot af work this week, but nothing really notable. Next week I will be coming with a probably bigger update than normally, hopefully containing a full design mock of the web app! I'm still working on this, and also working on getting some collaborations together for Mellonn.
Although I do not have much for you this week, I do have a big announcement... I have had my first ORGANIC paying customer! I really can't describe how this feels, I'm beginning to see that my many hours of work, can really pay off. It's a good feeling. Although it wasn't completely without problems... But I will talk about that next week.


## See you again next week!
Wasn't it a good a good idea? I think it was, but I don't think the robots will be taking over just yet... Oh well, happy 1st. of April, and i will get back to actual work, I've had my fun ðŸ˜‰.
Have a good weekend, and don't take everything too serious today..
