## Description

![[Slack_Interface.jpg|600]]

The Slack interface is divided into three main parts, the workspace overview, the top bar and the chat itself. 
Firstly the workspace overview has different channels you can choose from, and is the main place for choosing what and who you want to write to. By being a desktop app, they have chosen to make all the different options small and dense, while many mobile focused interfaces make these big and touch focused. At the top the currently selected workspace is displayed, also allowing the user to switch into another workspace. To the right of the workspace name a contrasted button allows the user to create a new message.
The top bar is small and looks much like a web browsers' address bar. Having both back/forward buttons, history, search bar, help and a profile picture. The search bar allows the user to search in the selected workspace, and has some extra filtering options that can be accessed by pressing the small icon on the far right. When clicking the profile icon, the user is presented by  both profile options and the ability to access applications options.
The chat section itself looks a lot like Discord's chat, both being one sided, with both the user's and other's messages being placed on the left in the interface. Each message is built up on the profile logo of the user sending the message, the name of the user, time the message has been sent, and the message itself. Underneath the messages is the text box in which the user can write a message themselves. This text box presents the user with a vast variety of formatting options for writing the message.

## Reflection

![[Slack_Replication_Interface.jpg|600]]

It is quite hard recreating a more complex UI, like the one Slack uses, especially with all the functionality there is in their desktop UI. I set out to at least get all the main parts of the UI in place, like the search bar, workspace overview and of course the chat section. Each section presented its own challenges, but I'm happy with the outcome, because it does resemble the Slack UI I went for. Some thing like the margins and paddings could be a lot more finely tuned and I could also have changed the font to Slack's font.
One thing I found surprisingly easy was getting the icons I have used. I ended up using the Fontawesome icon library, which can be easily integrated into a static html site.
