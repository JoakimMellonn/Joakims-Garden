1. **TDD Fundamentals**:
    - Focuses on writing reliable and maintainable software, ensuring "clean code that works"​​.
    - Emphasizes simplicity, focus, and taking small steps​​.
    - Involves a five-step rhythm: adding a test, running all tests to see the new one fail, making a little change, running all tests again to see success, and then refactoring to remove duplication​​.
      
2. **Key Principles**:
    - **Test First**: Write tests before the code that is to be tested. This approach may seem counterintuitive, as it involves testing something that doesn't yet exist​​.
    - **Automated Test**: Use automated tests to continuously verify that recent modifications haven't introduced defects. Manual testing is seen as inefficient due to its labor-intensive nature​​.
    - **One Step Test**: Choose the next test from the list that will teach you the most, adhering to the principle of small, manageable steps​​.
      
3. **Benefits of TDD**:
    - Provides fast feedback, boosting programmer confidence. Breaking problems into smaller, more manageable steps facilitates quicker solutions and progress tracking​​.
      
4. **TDD Rhythm**:
    - A continuous cycle that keeps the focus on implementing one task at a time and making each small addition work before proceeding​​.
    - **The TDD rhythm consists of five steps:**
	    - **Quickly Add a Test**:
		    - Start by writing a new test case for the specific functionality you want to add. This test should initially fail since the functionality hasn't been implemented yet.
		- **Run All Tests and See the New One Fail**:
		    - Run your entire suite of tests, including the new test. The new test should fail, confirming that the new functionality is not yet implemented. This step validates that the test is correctly detecting an absence of the new feature.
		- **Make a Little Change**:
		    - Modify your production code with the minimum change necessary to make the new test pass. This often involves just enough coding to meet the test's requirements, without immediately considering broader design issues.
		- **Run All Tests and See Them All Succeed**:
		    - Run the entire test suite again. This time, the new test should pass, alongside all previous tests. This ensures that the new code addition hasn't negatively impacted existing functionalities.
		- **Refactor to Remove Duplication**:
		    - Once the new test passes, examine your code for any duplications, inconsistencies, or opportunities for improvement. Refactor the code to make it cleaner and more maintainable, ensuring not to change its behavior. After refactoring, run the tests again to ensure that all tests still pass.
