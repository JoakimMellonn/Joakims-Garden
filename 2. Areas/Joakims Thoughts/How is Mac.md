Yea... this is where I am right now. I've just gotten the MacBook Pro 14", with the M1 Pro, and so far it's absolutely a beast.
This is just some notes, where I can express my feelings about the experience, so my family doesn't have to listen to me ramble.

## Build quality
This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, but this thing is an absolute tank. It at least feels like it. It's extremely heavy for a 14" laptop, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's a lot. 1.6 kg, is still 300g heavier than the Razer Blade Stealth I'm coming from, which I thought was a hefty beast, this thing is another class.
The build quality itself is very nice, with zero to none deck flex. But (again), this shouldn't come as a surprise, with Apple having perfected the aluminium chassis.

### Keyboard
The keyboard is one of the widely discussed subject, when it comes to Apple computers. When coming from a Razer Blade, I have been used to a very nice feeling keyboard. And with having tried the Butterfly keyboard quite a lot, I can definitely say that Apple have improved in this department. Who knew it would be a good idea to not reinvent the wheel, and just go back to what works?

### Ports
Speaking of not reinventing the wheel and going back to what works... The ports! What earlier was the lack thereof, is now a nice selection. But that's all I would call it, nice selection. I will still not go as far as to say that this is my goto port selection. That's mostly because I don't use either HDMI or SD-cards. My external monitor uses USB-C (because Apple had the courage), and my camera uses XQD or CF-Express. But still I will not be mad that they added ports again. Where I am irritated, is the fact that they couldn't add a USB-A, that would've been the easiest thing to add.
Credit where credit is due, but I guess I will still have to take my dongles with me everywhere.

### Display
Oh boy... This thing is an absolute beauty, oh my! With having a high pixel density, at least high enough, that those with the sharpest of eyes can't see individual pixels. But the resolution isn't the star of this show...
That is definitely the Mini-LED backlighting. This panel is providing the absolute best HDR experience i have ever had, the only thing that comes close to this is my Samsung phone, and that's saying a lot. The brightness absolutely blinds me when shining those 1600nits, and the contrast is very good, still not OLED level of course, but great!


## Performance
With Apple doing what I would call an interesting move, by creating their own chips, they set themselves up for either a massive failure or a massive success. In this situation I must admit that this is definitely a success. The performance is SO good, and battery is also very good.
With starting a debug session being just about as fast (maybe a few seconds slower) than my desktop Windows computer. This computer is running a 12-core fifth gen. Ryzen processor, and an RTX 3080. That's impressive. Although the Mac did cost 20% more than my desktop, so it doesn't come cheap in any way. I haven't tried photo editing on the Mac, yet...

### Battery
The battery is in most cases very good, but it has been acting kinda weird. With some charges holding on for, what feels like forever, and others killing the battery outa nowhere. It has to be said that I have been using this machine for work (it is a work machine). That means I have been coding on it, and debugging the app I'm working on. Today it got through the whole work day (about 7 hours), with 30% left on charge. I would definitely say that's a win. With my Razer blade having to be charged half way through the day, and that was with doing school work (word and internet surfing). Most programs doesn't really take a lot of life out of the battery, and it feels like it's the display that take the most, with viewing HDR content.


## Software
The software is a whole other story from the hardware let's be honest... At some point i saw someone describing the Apple software experience right now, as feeling like being a beta tester. Coming from Windows this isn't something new, but with Apple's always saying "It just works", and it's a "seamless" experience.
That is the last thing i would call my experience...

### Setting up MacOS
Setting up the OS was a rather quick and painless experience. That was until I got into the system and had to setup the App Store. This was something... Opening the App Store to download Xcode, it said that I had to log into the App Store with my Apple ID. Wait what? But I logged in with my Apple ID when setting up the computer, shouldn't it then be logged in pretty much everywhere? Isn't that what a seamless experience is? Apparently not.
I logged in, and it said that I have to set up the rest of my account to proceed. I said ok to that, and I had to log in again... Do you see where this is going?
When I logged in again, it failed or something (it didn't give me an error or something). Then it came with the same message, that I had to set up the rest of my account to proceed, and here we are, in an infinite loop of me not being able to use the App Store.
Going onto Google to check if anyone else have had the same problem, low and behold someone's out there having the same problem. The fix was updating the OS, because automatic update wasn't turned on by default, isn't that part of the seamless experience?

### Updating the system
Most people know about the notorious Windows Update experience, it's something many people have joked with. The thing is, those who complain about Windows Update, they have clearly never used a Mac as their daily driver. It's simply not a good experience.
You get a notification on the top right of the screen, saying there's an update available, this is nice, I'm notified. But this notification doesn't go away.. You get the option to remind you, but not the option to just ignore it. I have turned on the automatic updates, for the sole reason that i don't have to think about it. And now they're still coming with this reminder, that I shouldn't need.

Having already brought up Windows Update, let's also talk about the issue of the system updating on inappropriate times. I will be honest, in the about 10 years I've used Windows, I have NEVER had that experience, but in the less than two months I've had a Mac, I've experienced it TWICE. Can you guess how many updates there's been in the less than two months? Two.

### Design
Let's just take a break from the functionality of the software, and take a look at the design. I've always looked at Apple like a premium design company, more than an innovative tech giant. But right now, I'm not quite sure what Apple is. With the hardware itself, they're definitely a premium design company, but with the software, I'm not even sure I would call them innovative.

MacOS absolutely is a beautifully designed system, but only if you take everything apart and looking at the elements individually. There's not really a clear design language, everything looks different, it looks like there have been a lot of designers that haven't been working together. One of the clearest indications of this, is the icons throughout the system, they're absolutely awful compared to the Windows counterpart. Just open the "System Preferences" and look at the main menu, it's a mess. They're different shapes, sizes, some of the are nicely coloured, some are not, some are 3D, others are 2D, do you see where I'm going?

If we just stay in the System Preferences, let's click on a sub category, what happens then? The whole window changes its size. When looking at the 33 different pages in there, I counted 11 different page designs, 11! The design repetition is nonexistent at best, and this is the experience throughout the whole system. I think Apple have tried too hard to create a new and curated experience for every single part of their system, that they have forgotten the overall experience.

### The work experience
Speaking of the overall experience, what I bought this computer for was work. As you probably already have figured, this haven't been all sunshine and rainbows either.
