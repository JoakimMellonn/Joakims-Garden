# Our Use in Project
- We use pretty much all the basic components in our project.
	- Resistors.
		- We use pull-up resistors for the reset pin and for some buttons.
		- We use pull-down resistors for the wire module connected to the wires.
	- We use diodes on the keypad, and should also have used it on the vibration motor.
	- We optimally should have used a transistor (ideally MOSFET to limit current draw) to power the vibration motor.
	- Ceramic capacitors was used to stabilize power to the crystal, which was used as an external clock for the ATmega328p.
- To power the prototype we used two $9000mAh$, $3.6V$ NiMH batteries which were connected in parallel making it a total of $18000mAh$ and $3.6V$.
	- To make the batteries deliver $5V$ to the prototype we connected it to a boost converter (which have an efficiency of about 92%).
	- The estimate total power draw for the prototype is $2.1W$, and the batteries have a capacity of $64.8Wh$, making the total battery life (including the efficiency loss from the boost converter) for the prototype about 30 hours.

- **Flow:** Current (I)
- **Hose width:** Resistance ($\Omega$)

# Ohms Law (and Watt)
![[Ohms_Law.jpg|350]]

Voltage, Current and Resistance are all related with Ohms law. $I$ means 'Intensit√§t'.

$$Voltage (V) = Current (I) \cdot Resistance (R)$$
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$
$$R=\frac{V}{I}$$
## Watt
To calculate Watt we can also use Ohms law to help us:
$$Watt(P)=V\cdot I$$
$$P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}$$
$$P=I^{2}\cdot R$$

# Components
## Resistors
Resistors can be used to limit the amount of current running through a system.
Unit is Ohms $(\Omega)$.

Resistors use a color code to show resistance:
1. First digit
2. Second digit
3. Third digit
4. Multiplier
5. Tolerance

It is much easier to measure with a multimeter.

### Pull-up/Pull-down Resistors
They are used to ensure a signal to a pin is in HIGH/LOW state.

- Pull-up: resistor connected directly to VCC
- Pull-down: resistor connected directly to Ground

## Series and Parallel Circuits
Current flow towards a lower voltage (from high to low). There will always flow current through every part of a circuit.

### Series
Components are in series when they are placed back to back in the circuit, so the same current flows through them.

### Parallel
Components are in parallel when they placed besides each other in the circuit, so the current is split between them.
In parallel all components will have the same voltage drop across them.

### Batteries
- Series: batteries in series have their relative voltage added.
- Parallel: batteries in parallel have their current added (with batteries it is the capacity).

### Resistors
- Series: Adds the resistance.
$$R_{1}+R_{2}+R_3+...$$
- Parallel: Decreases the resistance.
$$R_{Total}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+...$$


# Voltage Dividers
A Voltage divider can be used to turn a large voltage into a smaller one. This is done by using two resistors in series where $V_{out}$ is between the two resistors.
![[Voltage_Divider.jpg|250]]

$$V_{out}=V_{in} \cdot \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}$$

## Variable [[#Resistors]]
Variable resistors is like the name implies, a component which can change its resistance.
- Potentiometers.
- Photocell (LDR, Light Dependent Resistor).
- Thermistor.


# Capacitors
A capacitor charges when there's excess energy in the circuit and discharges when there's need for it. Capacitance (C) is measured in Farads (F).

$$Total\ charge=C*V$$
The capacitor can help stabilize the power delivery for a microcontroller, so that it doesn't restart if the voltage drops.

## Types
### Ceramic Capacitors
Ceramic capacitors are not polarized and are generally a tank, but they mostly can't take too high voltages. They range from a few picofarads to 1-2 microfarads.

### Electrolytic Capacitors
Less externally impacted, higher voltages and farads (capacitance) but less temperature stable.

## Decoupling Capacitors
These can be used to suppress high frequency noise when a power supply briefly drops voltage. They're placed between VCC and GND. They should also be located as close to the IC (Microcontroller) as possible. Try with $10\mu F$, $10\mu F$ or and 100$nF$.


# Crystals
Crystals are clocks for a microcontroller, they're measured in Hz.
- When providing voltage to a piece of quartz crystal, it creates vibrations (piezo-electric effect).
	- The vibrations (oscillations) are then used as a waveform for the clock.
- For microcontrollers each pin on the crystal should be connected with a $15pF$ to $33pF$ capacitor to GND and directly to the OSC1 and OSC2 pin on the controller.


# Diodes
Diodes are found in most devices, and only allows electricity to flow in one direction. Since they only allow the energy to flow in one direction, they are polarized. The energy flows from + to -.
- Cathode (-).
- Anode (+).
- Most diodes starts working when voltage exceeds $0.7V$.

## Shunting
Shunting can be used to rerouting power to be useful instead of wasting it by just simple grounding it. The rerouting happens because the power wants to go down the path of lowest resistance, and a diode can do this, without shorting VCC to GND.

## LEDs
LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes), just like normal diodes are polarized, but they emit light when powered.
LEDs both require a minimum amount of power to work, but also a maximum, they will burn out if the maximum is reached.

# Transistors
Transistors are solid semiconductors that are switching devices. They can be used as gates, voltage stabilization, signal modulation and some other functions.

A small current, from eg. a microcontroller, going into the base, will switch a much larger current coming from collector going to emitter. The current going into the base will also go out the emitter.

## Resistor
Going into the base, a transistor requires a resistor. When in a $5V$ system, the resistance should be around $1K\Omega$.

## Types
### BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor)
This common transistor can turn a current on and off, by applying current to the base.
They consist of three pins:
- Collector.
- Base.
- Emitter.

BJTs are current controlled devices.
### MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor)
A MOSFET will turn on as long as the voltage applied to the gate is greater than a certain threshold. A current limiting resistor is not necessary.
They consist of three pins:
- Drain (Similar to the Collector on a BJT).
- Gate. 
- Source.

MOSFETs are voltage controlled devices, hence they don't need the current limiting resistor. They have such high impedance on the gate that they practically don't draw any current.

## Current flow
A transistor can be anywhere from "Fully on" to "Fully off". A small current coming into the base, can then control the big current coming from the collector. This is called **Amplification**.

## NPN and PNP
In an NPN transistor current flows from collector and base to emitter.
In an PNP transistor current flows from emitter to collector.


# Logic Gates

## AND Gate
AND gates checks if both input A and B is 1 (true), if they are it will output 1, if not it will output 0.

## OR Gate
OR gates checks if either A or B is 1, if none of them are it will output 0, otherwise it will output 1.

## XOR Gate
XOR gates only output 1 if one of the inputs are 1.

## NAND and NOR Gate
NAND and NOR gates output the opposite of their counterparts (AND and OR).

# Powering The Prototype
When powering prototypes in this course we only focus on DC (Directs Current) power. When prototyping the easiest way is to just use an USB cable from your computer. But for the final product it will have to be powered by batteries.
Some important questions to answer before powering a prototype:
- How much voltage is needed?
	- For our case we will be focusing on getting about $5V$ since that's the most common amount for microcontrollers. It is okay to give them a bit more or less than $5V$ since their range is about $2.7V$ to $5.5V$.
- How much current is needed?
	- This is much dependent on the components used. Check the datasheets or use a multimeter!
	- Generally if a motor is used, or something else that is power hungry, you will need a larger power supply.
	- Power supplies need to supply at least X amount of amps, but it's okay for this number to be higher than the amount needed.
	- Not enough current is referred to as a brown out.
- How long should it be powered?
	- Batteries is measured in ampere-hours (Ah) or milliampere-hours (mAh).
	- When batteries are connected in series they should always be of the same chemistry.
	- Connecting batteries in series adds the voltage together. Adding them in parallel adds the current together (higher capacity).
- Is recharging an options?
	- This is dependent on the type of battery chemistry used.
		- AA, AAA, C and D, $9V$ (Alkaline or Zinc-carbon) are not rechargable.
		- Coin cells (Lithium) are also not rechargable.
		- Silver flat pack (LiPo - Lithium Polymer) are rechargable.
		- AA, AAA, C and D (NiMH NiCd) are rechargable.
		- Car battery (Six-cell lead acid) are rechargable.

## Calculating the Circuit Current
This is done by adding up the total amount of current used by all components in the circuit. 

Example:
ATmega328p = $14mA$.
3 red LEDs with $330\Omega$ resistors = $10mA$ per LED.
2 motors = $25mA$ per motor.

Total highest possible current:
$$14mA + (3\cdot 10mA) + (2\cdot 25mA) = 94mA \approx 100mA$$
Now to calculate how long the circuit will last on battery:
$$\frac{BatteryCapacity(Amphours)}{CurrentDraw(Amps)} = BatteryLife(Hours)$$
$$\frac{2000mAh}{100mA}=20h$$
## DC-DC Converters
There are two types of DC-DC converters:
- Step-down (buck converter).
	- Output voltage is lower than the input voltage.
- Step-up (boost converter).
	- Output voltage is higher than the input voltage.
	- Can be used to provide $5V$ from a LiPo (usually $3.6V$).
	- There's alway some efficiency loss, 20% to 30% is a good conservative estimate.

## Multiple Power Sources
When using power hungry components such as motors or LED strips, you will need to connect them to a separate power source. But when doing this, you should still have common GND. The voltage is always in respect (relative) to the GND.
