# Our Use in Project
- We have used FDM 3D printing to make all the tops for our modules.
	- We have prioritised using PLA, because it's much easier to work with, but for the batteries/empty modules we have used ASA (Akrylonitril Styren Acrylat), because the orange color we wanted was only available in that material.
	- The quick connects have also been made using FDM printing.
	- We have generally used FDM printing to do rapid prototyping, to see if something works or not.
- To create the outer box, and module walls we have used laser cutting.
	- We first did it in card board, to check the dimensions with a much cheaper material.
	- Then we did it with MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) for the final product.
	- The MDF was post processed to give it the right color, and to make the modules fit better.
- Everything have been modeled in Fusion360, to get the right dimensions and to make renders of how the final product should look.

# 3D Modeling
With CAD (Computer Aided Design) it's easy, or accessible, to create 3D models of a design, to represent them in 3D instead of the normal 2D which sketches does. It's often done products, prototyping and manufacturing in mind. Some tools that can be used for CAD is Rhino 3D and Fusion360, many other programs can be used. In this course we mostly use 3D modeling with 3D printing and visualization in mind.

## NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline)
This method is preferred by engineers.
NURBS concepts:
- Curve: points, lines and segments makes up the model.
- Surface: a plane without thickness created between a group of closed curves.
- Polysurface: a set of multiple contiguous surfaces.
- Solid: a completely closed and joined polysurface.

## Meshes
This method is preferred by artists.
Mesh concepts:
- Vertices: position along mesh.
- Edge: a connection between two vertices.
- Faces: a closed set of edges that form a plane without thickness.
- Polygon: a coplanar set of faces that build a closed or open volume.

## Tips for 3D Modeling
- Use the available 3D model libraries, no point in reinventing the wheel.
- Be consistent with sizes.
- Be aware of the printer's size.
- Closed polysurfaces = good, open polysurfaces = not good. 
	- This is why we use NURBS for 3D printing.
- Naked edges = bad.
- Hollowing = good.
	- Hollowing is a good way of saving time when printing a 3D model.
	- This is done when choosing infill under 100%.
- Make wall thickness a multiple of nozzle size.
- Use chamfer and fillet on stress points (sharp angles like 90 degrees).
- Remember the 45 degree rule. Use support material when printing angles sharper than 45 degrees.
	- You can also use chamfer to achieve the 45 degree rule.
- Bridging (free floating) is bad, but doable.
- Create round horizontal holes shaped like a water drop instead of using support.
- Create custom supports.
- Use some tolerance to make things fit together, FDM printers are precise, but not that precise.
- Avoid exaggerated details.
- Make boss'es (female to male joints), to put prints together. Use gussets, ribs and/or walls to make them more stable.
- Living hinges can be made by making thin plastic connections.
- Useful plugins for Fusion360.
	- T-Splines: make curvature easier to control on complex models.
	- Dynamo: a visual programming language for parametric modelling.
- Incorporate your PCB(s) using Fusion360's built in functionality.

# 3D Printing
When 3D printing there are two main methods of manufactoring: Additive and Subtractive manufactoring.

## Additive and Subtractive Manufactoring
**Additive manufactoring:**
3D objects are constructed successively in layers, to create the designed 3D object.

**Subtractive manufactoring:**
3D objects are constructed by cutting away pieces from a solid block of material.

### Additive Manufactoring

#### FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)
Also called FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication), 3D objects are created by extruding small flattened strings of material to form layers. The material hardens as it's extruded from the nozzle. The filament used is made from thermoplastic materials:
- ABS (Acrynolitrine Butadiene Styrene).
	- Strong temperature resistant, can have problems sticking to the bed, sharp corners are difficult and it smells.
- PLA (Polylactide).
	- Feels and looks glossy, biodegradable, low warping, easy to post process. Generally easy to work with.
- PET(G) (Polyethylene Terephthalate (Glycol-modified)).
	- Strong and very hard to post process, high temperature requirements, stringing, low warping, low shrinking.
- And many other new materials.
#### SLA (Stereolithography)
SLA uses liquid photo-reactive resin, a laser then traces each layer on the surface of the resin. The laser light cures and solidifies the parts of resin which it hits.
SLA is very good for very detailed prints, like small models with highly detailed parts.
#### SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)/DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering)
Much like SLA, but instead of using resin it is powder (plastics, ceramic, glass or metal), other than that the platform also descends instead of ascending. For each layer, a layer of new powder is rolled over the bed.
SLS makes it very easy to print something inside another print (print in place models), because the powder acts as support material.
#### Other Methods
- Plaster Based 3D Printing.
	- Much like SLS, but instead of a laser, an Inkjet printer heads prints with adhesive.
- Thermal Phase Change.
	- Inkjet print head jets heated liquid plastic. Like FDM the material solidifies as it's cooled down. Excess material is removed by a milling head.
	- Extremely high resolution. Slow printing time, and limited material choices.
	- Used for casting patterns, almost never final production.
- LOM (Laminated Object Manufactoring).
	- Sheet is adhered to substrate with a heated roller.
	- Laser traces desired shape for object. Laser cross hatches non-part area to facilitate waste removal.
	- Platform with finished layer moves down out of the way.
### Subtractive Manufactoring
#### CNC (Computer Numerical Control)
CNC machines are computer controlled machine shop tools. They can work with pretty much any type of material (metals, wood, plastics and fiberglass).
Some of the most used CNC machines:
- Drilling.
	- A spinning drill bit, removed the stationary material it comes into contact with.
- Milling.
	- Rotary cutting tools is used to remove bits from the stationary material. Can be used with many types of router bits. This is the most common type of CNC machines.
- Lathes.
	- Lathes spins the material against the stationary drill/mill bit.
#### Laser Cutting
A laser cutter uses a laser to cut through or engrave material. They can be used to cut through a wide range of materials. Right now laser cutters commonly use CO2 lasers, but newer ones begins to use diode or fiber lasers. They are more precise than CNCs, because a laser is so thin.

## Slicers
A slicer is a piece of software which converts the 3D models (.stl, .obj, etc.) to a 3D printable format (.gcode). Gcode is a format which is basically 3D coordinates as instruction to a printer. Slicers interpret the design of the 3D model, not just creates the instructions for the printer. The most used/popular slicers for 3D printing:
- PrusaSlicer (Prusa Printers).
- CURA (Ultimaker/Creality).
- Simplify3D ("Pro").

### Slicer Settings
The first layer is always the most important layer, it can make or break the 3D print. It should be thicker than all other layers.
#### Layer Height
Layer height affects the number of layers in a model, and therefore affects print time, but also affects the quality of the print. Lower layer height = longer print time, higher quality. Higher layer height = shorter print time, lower quality.
#### Infill
Infill is the structure used inside an object, it's not solid. Percentage and pattern affects the weight, strength and production time of the model. Higher percentage = longer print time, stronger print. Lower percentage = shorter print time, weaker print. 5-20% is typically enough, above 50% is diminished returns, and 100% is strongest. Different patterns can be used for different use cases, some are very strong but only in one direction (rectilinear).
#### Shells
The shell is the walls of the print, how many shells is chosen is the amount of layers the walls have and thus will be solid. Insufficient shells can make a print less stable and see through but also adds to print time.
#### Rafts, Brims and Skirts
**Rafts:**
- Horizontal latticework of filament underneath the model.
- Used with ABS to help with warping and bed adhesion, also to help smaller models staying stable during print.
**Brims:**
- Like the skirt, but is attached to the model.
- Used to help with warping and bed adhesion.
**Skirts:**
- An outline that surrounds your print, but doesn't touch it.
- Helps prime the extruder and establish a smooth flow of material.

## Tips If Prints Go Wrong
- Clogged nozzle.
	- Change the nozzle.
- Filament stuck.
	- Check or pull.
- 1st layer.
	- Calibrate or clean the bed.
- Not working.
	- Calibrate, clean bed and fix settings.
- Pillowing.
	- Make sure cooling fans are going at full speed, or print a thicker top layer.
- Warping.
	- Try with higher bed temperature, check if you get a good first layer.
	- Try with making a brim or raft.
- Under extrusion.
	- Calibrate, check for clogged nozzle, higher temperature, last resort: extrusion multiplier.
- Stringing.
	- Enable retraction, so the printer will retract the filament before moving the printer head.
	- Higher travel speed or changing the filament to PLA can also help. Or try with a lower temperature.
- First layer.
	- Calibration.
	- Cleaning the bed!
	- Proper bed temperature.
	- Decrease speed on first layer.

## Post Processing
Post processing can be used to make your 3D prints stand out, or just give them the desired color or surface texture. You will need the following:
- Sandpaper.
- Primer.
- Spray paint.
It takes a lot of time, so you will need to plan ahead. Sanding should be done with decreasing coarseness. Priming about 1-3 layers. This should be repeated 1-10 times depending on the desired result. The paint should be at least a couple of layers, until the desired color has been achieved.
