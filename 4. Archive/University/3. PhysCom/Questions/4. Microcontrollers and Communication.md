# Our Use in Project
We use four ATmega328p in our project and I2C to get them to talk to each other.
- For most of the modules we have to use the ATmega328p, because we need a lot of the pins. While for the disarm button, we probably could have used an ATtiny. We didn't do this because at that point had more experience with the ATmega328p, and for a proof of concept it doesn't make too much sense.
- We used I2C to make the modules communicate with each other.
	- We chose I2C because of the one to many communication. And chose it over SPI to only use two pins between the modules. The amount of data also doesn't require SPI.
	- We wanted the ability to connect nearly limitless modules (128).
	- We ran into some problems last minute, for unknown reasons. 
		- Could be because we didn't use a pull-up resistor.
		- Could be code related problems.
		- Could be PCB problems (because some of them worked without problems).

# Microcontroller
A microcontroller is a small computer on a chip. They have a processor just like a computer, although it's much slower. It can be programmed with many different languages, C, C++, Rust...
In this course we have used Arduino as a programmer, which uses a flavor of C.

- MCU - Microcontroller Unit.
- SOC - System On a Chip.

MCUs are everywhere, roughly 55% of all CPUs sold are 8-bit microcontrollers. The typical home in a developed country have about 40 MCUs. They're in many types of devices.

## AVR
AVR is the name of microchips from the Atmel Corporation. They are mostly very small and not too powerful. Their flash memory is mostly between 1KB to 32KB and they have a very limited amount of RAM (Random Access Memory). They're 8-bit CPUs (Central Processing Unit) without a math-coprocessor, not to say they're very basic.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages 
- They're much smaller than having multiple ICs.
- Much greater flexibility, they can be programmed to do a lot more than simple ICs.

### Disadvantages
- They're often more expensive than ICs.
- They're not very powerful, not enough for some more processing expensive tasks like machine learning.

## Microcontroller types

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| PIC                          | Less expensive, less powerful and less power hungry. |
| AVR                          | More powerful than PIC, more power hungry too.       |
| MSP                          | Good for low power applications.                     |
| ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) | Very powerful and cheap.                             |
| 8051                         | Developed by Intel in the 1980's.                    |
| 68HC08/11                    | Developed by Motorola often lacks RAM.               |

The first microchip, the Intel 8008 was created in 1972.

- Easy to control power usage with deep sleep functionality.

## Microcontroller Pins
Every microcontroller have pins to be able to actually use them. As a minimum they will all need the following pins:
- VCC and GND pins.
- Programming pins, on ATmega328p these are the RX, TX and RESET pins.
- GIO (General Input/Output) pins.

Almost all pins are capable of digital IO, some also have the capability of doing analog IO. For pin numbering just look at the datasheet, although on DIP-packages (Dual In-line Package) chips the numbering mostly starts at the top left.

## Memory
### Flash
Non-volatile (they don't forget when they lose power). Only loses 1 bit per million in 100 years at room temperature.
### RAM
Random Access Memory, volatile (forgets when they lose power) memory for storing temporary variables while the program is running. This is where the Stack and Heap is located, when the program runs.
### EEPROM
Slow to write but non-volatile, for configuration data.

## Clock
Internal RC oscillator is an 8MHz clock and is the master clock source. There are separate clock for the IO sub-system, ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), flash and EEPROM.
On the ATmega328p you can put on an external 16MHz crystal, to make them much more reliable.

## Analog IO
With the analog input you can measure the voltage on an analog pins, that lies between LOW and HIGH voltage ($0$ and $5V$). On Arduino the values will range between 0 (LOW) and 1023 (HIGH).
### ADC
In most AVRs there's a built in ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). Every ADC have a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) and a comparator built in.
The DAC generates a voltage that corresponds to a digital value that it takes as input. The comparator is a digital device â€“ outputs high or low based on higher or lower. Approximation.
On the ATmega328p the pins PC0 to PC5 are always analog pins.

## Programming Microcontrollers
To program a microcontroller, we have to use the instruction set provided by the processor. These instructions can be some of these:
- Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide.
- Logic.
- Jumps, Branches.

When writing in a compiled language (like C, C++ or Rust), you don't have to think about the instruction set, that's the compiler's job. This is how code will look in Assembly using the instruction set vs in C/C++.

The environment used to programming a microcontroller, can be chosen by preference. The most popular is probably Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). While some others could be:
- AVR Studio.
- Eclipse.
- Bascom.
- VS-Code.

To upload the code to the microcontroller, you have to use a chip programmer. You can buy a dedicated programmer, but you can also just use an Arduino without a chip, and connect it with the RX/TX, RESET and probably also VCC and GND if it's not powered externally.


# Communication Protocols
## I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
This protocol is created by Philips. It relies on a single bus with address specific communication, using the SDA and SCL pins. Each slave each have their own address (0-127).

## SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
MISO/MOSI/SCK/SS pins used for master-slave communication.

## UART/USART
RX/TX pins used for serial communication. This is used when using serial monitor on a computer, and uploading code to a chip. USART uses a different clock pin.
