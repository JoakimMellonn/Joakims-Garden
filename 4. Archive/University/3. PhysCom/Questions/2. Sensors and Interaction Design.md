# Our Use in Project
- We haven't used the most advanced types of sensors in our project. Actually it's closer to some of the simplest types of sensors.
	- Buttons. We have used different types of buttons, all of them from arcade machines, which makes for satisfying clicks.
	- 3.5mm jack plugs, both male and female. These were used for the reorient wires game. It is debatable whether or not these are actually sensors.
- When developing more different modules for the game, we could most definitely implement more types of sensors.
	- FSR or load cell to make the player press on something with a specific force?

# Sensors
Computers use sensors to sense things just like humans do.

**Definition:**
A sensor converts a physical signal into an electrical signal that can be manipulated symbolically on a computer.

### Gaze and Eye-tracking
Gaze detection refers to detecting where a person is looking. This is mostly done by tracking infrared illuminants off the eye's cornea. It still requires calibration on a per user basis.

### Gestures
Gestures are specific movements of a specific bodypart, in most cases we talk about gestures as handmovement.
Accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used to detect gestures, but as computer vision has gotten much better, it is also popular to use.

## Sensor data
You should know how to convert the raw data received from a sensor, to something usable. This can be found in the datasheet for the sensor. As an example you should convert the output of an accelerometer to g's of acceleration, so you can understand the output easier.

## Filters
Some times the output of a sensor can be quite messy. This is where you can use filters to clean that output up. The digital filters you can use is something like the median filter or a moving average. They can both clean up the data from outliers.
