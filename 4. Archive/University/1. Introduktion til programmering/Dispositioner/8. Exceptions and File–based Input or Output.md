## Forklaringer

1. Defensive programming
	1. Defensive programming is done by programming with error handling in mind.
2. Exception-throwing
	1. Exceptions are objects representing details in a program failure.
	2. Programs in Java throw exceptions to let the client know something went wrong.
3. Checked and unchecked exceptions
	1. Checked exception: they require extra checks from the compiler. In particular, checked exceptions in Java require the use of throws clauses (clause in the method header) and try statements. All subclasses of `Exception` are checked exceptions.
	2. Unchecked exception: they won't require checks from the compiler. All subclasses of `RuntimeException` are unchecked exceptions.
4. Exception handling
	1. Exception handling is only required with checked exceptions.
5. Try-catch statement
	1. You can use the try-catch statement to safely catch any exception that may be thrown.
	2. The try block has the code that should be executed, and can throw an exception.
	3. The catch block(s) should catch the exceptions thrown in the try block.
	4. You can also add the finally block, whose code will be executed, regardless of any return statements or thrown exceptions that aren't caught.
6. Assertions
	1. An assertion can be used when developing, to help catch error in the process. They will be omitted from the final build by the compiler.
	2. JUnit assertions can be used also in this process, but they will appear like when doing unit testing.
7. File-based input/output
	1. The Java API supports input/output of both textual and binary data via readers, writers, and streams.
	2. IO can be likely to throw exceptions, and some of the most common are `FileNotFoundException` and `EOFException`, they are both subclasses of `IOException`.
	3. To make file-handling easier you can use Object Serialization.
8. Object serialization
	1. Serialization allows whole objects, and object hierachies, to be read and written in a single operation.
	2. Every object involved must be from a class that implements the `Serializable` interface.


### Eksempler

```java
//Try-catch statement
try {
	filename = requestFileFromUser();
	addressbook.saveToFile(filename);
	successful = true;
} catch (IOException e) {
	System.out.println("Unable to save to " + filename);
	successful = false;
}
```

```java
//Object serialization
public void saveToFile(String destinationFile) throws IOException {
	Path destination = Paths.get(destinationFile).toAbsolutePath();
	ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream(
		new FileOutputStream(destination.toString())
	);
	os.writeObject(book);
	os.close();
}
```
