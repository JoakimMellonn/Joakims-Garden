1. Lambdas
2. Streams
3. Filter, map, reduce
4. Pipelines
5. Intermediate and terminal operations


## Forklaringer

1. Lambdas
	1. A Lambda is a segment of code that can be stored and used later, in this regard it can be passed as a parameter.
	2. Return type and visibility is inferred from the context, and is therefore not needed when writing a Lambda.
	3. A Lambda doesn't have a name, unlike a normal method, and is therefore also known as anonymous functions.
2. Streams
	1. Elements in a Stream are not accessed via an index, but usually sequentially.
	2. The contents and ordering of a Stream cannot be changed, this requires the creation of a new Stream.
	3. Streams can be infinite.
3. Filter, map, reduce
	1. Filter: creates a new Stream with a subset of the elements in the original Stream, where the elements have been filtered out.
	2. Map: creates a new Stream with the same number of elements, but the type of content can be different, but derived from the original content.
	3. Reduce: creates a single result from the whole stream, you get one value from all the values in the stream.
4. Pipelines
	1. A pipeline is when you link multiple Stream-functions in a chain.
5. Intermediate and terminal operations
	1. Intermediate: when a Stream-function returns a new Stream.
	2. Terminal: when a Stream-function returns a result or a void.


### Eksempler

```java
public int getCount(String animal) {
	return sightings.stream()
					.filter(sighting -> sighting.getAnimal().equals(animal))
					.map(sighting -> sighting.getCount())
					.reduce(0, (total, count) -> total + count); //.sum()
}
```

```java
public class Sighting {
	private final String animal;
	private final int spotter;
	private final int count;
	private final int area;
	private final int period;
	...
}

public class AnimalMonitor {
	private ArrayList<Sighting> sightings;

	public AnimalMonitor() {...}

	public void printSightings () {
		sightings.forEach(sighting -> System.out.println(sighting.getDetails()));
	}

	public List<Sighting> getSightingsBy(int spotter) {
		return sightings.stream()
				        .filter(sighting -> sighting.getSpotter() == spotter)
				        .collect(Collectors.toList());
	}

	public int getCount(String animal) {
		return sightings.stream()
						.filter(sighting -> sighting.getAnimal().equals(animal))
						.map(sighting -> sighting.getCount())
						.reduce(0, (total, count) -> total + count); //.sum()
	}
}
```
