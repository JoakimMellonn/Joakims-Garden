Prototyping can be seen at consisting of four steps in software development:
- Functional selection
	- This refers to choosing what functions a prototype should have.
	- This isn't the same as what the final product should have.
	- Vertical and horizontal prototyping.
		- Vertical is when the functions included is in their intended final form, but not all functions are included.
		- Horizontal is when parts of the functions are omitted or simulated.
- Construction
	- This refers to the effort required to make the prototype usable.
	- The focus of the prototype should be to fulfill the requirements of the evaluation and not the final product.
- Evaluation
	- The evaluation should provide feedback for the further development process.
	- The evaluation should be conducted with intended users/customers, and should be easily updated to included new features if needed.
- Commitment
	- There should be a commitment to keeping essential feature as demonstrated for the evaluating users.

We used exploratory prototyping to create our prototype app. Because we would like to test whether our users would find it helpful to both a physical interface and an app interface. Had we continued developing the app after the evaluation, we would move onto doing experimental prototyping. And to get a more finished product, eg a prototype close to the final product, we would move onto doing evolutionary prototyping.

Notes:
- Interaction relabeling and extreme characters.
	- We could have done more to practise the interaction with potential users of the product, while developing the application.
- Implementing the app in steps, filters.
